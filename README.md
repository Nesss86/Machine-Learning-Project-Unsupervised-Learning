# Machine Learning Project - Unsupervised Learning

## EDA & Pre-Processing
- Data Import: Imported the dataset 
- Data Cleaning: Checked the dataset for any missing or incorrect data and cleaned the dataset accordingly.
- Data Description: Generated summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for each column of the dataset. 
- Data Visualization: Created various visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand the relationships and trends between the different variables in the dataset. F
- Outlier Detection: Checked for any outliers in the dataset and determined whether they were valid or erroneous data points.
- Correlation Analysis: Calculated the correlation between different variables in the dataset to determine which variables are highly correlated and which ones are not.
- Data Transformation:Transformed the data by standardizing the variables to make them comparable across different scales.
- Feature Selection: Identified the most important features or variables that contributed the most to the overall variance in the dataset.



## KMeans Clustering



## Hierarchial Clustering




## PCA






## Outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.
### Duration:
Approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes
### Project Description:
In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.
The project will involve the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.
-	Unsupervised learning: We will use the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together. We will determine the optimal number of clusters and communicate the insights gained through data visualization.

The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked.
