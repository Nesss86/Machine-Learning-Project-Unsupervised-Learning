# Machine Learning Project - Unsupervised Learning


### Project Description:
In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.
The project will involve the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.
-	Unsupervised learning: We will use the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together. We will determine the optimal number of clusters and communicate the insights gained through data visualization.

The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked.



## Project Outcomes
- The strongest correlation is between channel, milk, grocery and detergents_paper
- Channel 1 spent the most on fresh while Channel 2 spent the most on groceries
- Using the elbow method, the optimal k was determined to be 6 which makes sense given the amount of categories there were for spending
- Unsupervised Learning allowed the realization of spending trends to gain insights into what is being purchased the most and where. It makes it easier to predict knowing which items are more stronly related
